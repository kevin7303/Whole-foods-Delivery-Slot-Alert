# Wholefoods-Delivery-Slot-Alert
A simple python script that alerts when there are available delivery slots. 
This script was created during the peak uncertainty of COVID-19 and the time when grocery deliveries were not being able to keep up with demand. Delivery slots were rare and sporadic leading to time wasted refreshing the checkout page.

# Project Overview 
* A simple script that uses Selenium to automate the google chrome browser to refresh the checkout page at regular intervals
* Script uses windows sound and beep system to make an audio cue when a delivery slot is found to notify the user
* Also prints out the earliest slots today and tomorrow if available on the console
 

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** Selenium, tkinter.messagebox, sys, time, winsound 
**Additional Requirements:** Chromedriver that is compatible with your Google Chrome version.

* **Once at the checkout page, the script will periodically refresh the browser and check for available time slots. If a timeslot is found, a beep noise will alert you and the script will stop running. You do not need to monitor the page, feel free to minimze it.**
